/*
An interesting question asked in Googleâ€™s phone interview : suppose a row of parking lot with n spots, one of them is empty and n-1 spots are occupied with cars. Only one operation is allowed: move one car from its position to the empty spot. Given a initial order of cars and a final order, output steps needed to convert initial order to final oder with that operation.

Follow up: Minimize steps needed.

ex:

{1 2 3 -1 4 5}
move car 1 to empty spot(denoted as -1) will make it {-1,2,3,1,4,5}
push 1 to the output list because you move car 1 to the empty spot

suppose you have a initial order {1 2 3 -1 4 5} and a final order {5,1,-1,3,2,4}, you need to transfer {1 2 3 -1 4 5} to {5,1,-1,3,2,4}, push each car moved into a output list.
